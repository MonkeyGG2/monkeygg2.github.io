Genetry Dash:

An attempt to run accurate Geometry dash on the web! 

Created by Sotospro24.

This works with scratch but not the griffpatch one, this one is a 1:1 exact and accurate replica of the real game, in scratch with some modifications from turbowarp!

v1.0 is released!!! Enjoy! :) If there are any bugs please put them in the issues tab.
